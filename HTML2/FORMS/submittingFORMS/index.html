<!-- search form spree.io then creat an account then creat new aproject then go to new form and name it (contact form) then all we have to do is copy URL of forms endpoint -->
<!-- then in formspree go to the submission option to see forms submitted to it -->

<!-- To submit a form, you should set the action and the method of the form. The action attribute represents where data is sent. The method specifies how the data is sent and can be either GET or POST -->

<!-- With the POST method, form data is included in the body of the request. With the GET method, form data is included in the URL as query string parameters. Thatâ€™s why the GET method is often used when we need to enable bookmarking pages. In contrast, the POST method is used when we need to update the data. -->
